# Packet_-Sniffing_with-_Wireshark
This project demonstrates using Wireshark on Kali Linux to capture and analyze real-time network traffic. It covers the fundamentals of packet sniffing and showcases how various protocols communicate across a network.

# Project Summary
This project demonstrates real-time network packet sniffing and analysis using Wireshark. It includes inspecting common protocols (HTTP, DNS, ICMP, TCP, OCSP) to understand how data moves across a network.

# Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Kali Linux
- Terminal commands: `ping`, `curl`

# Analysing
I captured traffic by performing common actions like visiting websites, pinging servers, and initiating DNS lookups. Then I filtered and analyzed key protocols such as:

DNS – Domain resolution queries and responses

HTTP – Website requests and headers

ICMP – Ping packets and echo replies

TCP – 3-way handshakes and port communication

OCSP – Certificate status verification during HTTPS connections
